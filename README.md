### LaTEx class for a stylish resume.

This class provides macros and commands for a stylish CV/resume.

Using the class is easy:

+ \documentclass{rvca} % renders a 1 page format without details on work items
+ \documentclass[full]{rvca} % renders a full CV with details on work items.

Based on the original idea by Friggeri found at
